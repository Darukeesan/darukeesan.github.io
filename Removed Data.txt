              <p class="fs-large fg-dark">2-D IIR filter design is a challenging problem due to the difficulty in verifying stability. Optimization methods proposed so 
			  far predominantly consider the design of 2-D IIR filters having quadrantally-symmetric frequency responses, where the transfer functions have separable 
			  denominators. In this research, a WLS design method for 2-D IIR filters having arbitrary frequency response and stable in the P-BIBO sense is proposed. 
			  Proposed method considers transfer functions with nonseparable numerators and denominators having complex- and real-valued coefficients, respectively. The 
			  WLS design is formulated as an iterative second-order cone programming problem, which includes constraints to guarantee the P-BIBO stability. Design examples confirm 
			  that the proposed WLS method leads to P-BIBO stable 2-D IIR filters.</p>

              <p class="fs-large fg-dark">The number of coefficients of M-D FIR filters increases exponentially 
			  with the number of dimensions leading to significantly high computational complexities. A minimax design method for M-D 
			  FIR filters having sparse coefficients is proposed, therefore, having low computational complexities. Design of M-D FIR filters 
			  with arbitrary frequency responses and low group delays of which the coefficients are complex valued is considered. The minimax design is formulated as a second-order 
			  cone programming problem. Design examples confirm that M-D sparse FIR filters designed using the proposed method provide more than 60% reduction 
			  in the computational complexity for a similar error in the frequency response approximation compared to M-D FIR nonsparse filters designed using 
			  previously proposed minimax methods.</p>
